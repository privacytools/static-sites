However, you do not need to be a member of this homeserver to join our channels, and choosing a smaller instance or <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/installing-synapse">hosting your own</a> will help promote decentralization and performance in the Matrix fediverse!</p>

<h2 class="pt-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4>Is #general:privacytools.io chat encrypted?</h4>
<p><strong>No.</strong> Messages sent to the #general chat are encrypted from with client-to-server encryption, i.e. HTTPS. This means that your messages can't be viewed by an attacker on your network, or your ISP, etc. <strong>However</strong>, because this is a public chat room anybody can view your messages if they are a member, and newcomers will be able to see all message history. Do not say anything in rooms that don't use End-to-End (E2E) encryption that you wouldn't want tied to you personally.</p>

<h4>Isn't Matrix behind Cloudflare?</h4>
<p>Matrix.org is, Privacytools.io isn't. If you use our homeserver and our Riot install, you should be good.</p>

<h4>What happens when I remove a message in Riot?</h4>
<p>Your homeserver will send a removal request for that message and some clients will render it as a black line, but by editing the source it's possibly for homeserver to not respect it and do nothing. If the room is bridged to protocols that don't support message removals (IRC, XMPP), their users see nothing happening. Don’t say anything you wouldn’t want to remain in the chat forever.</p>

<h4>Why do XMPP users keep joining and leaving all the time?</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost/issues/63">It's an issue with the XMPP bridge</a>.</p>
